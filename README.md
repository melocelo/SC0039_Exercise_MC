# SC0039_Exercise_MC
Assignment_1: CSV assignment
Purpose: To write a script in python which takes brca_cnvs_tcga-1-2-2.csv, adds a new column that contains the length of each segment.

## How to run script:
1. Download the input CSV file "brca_cnvs_tcga-1-2-2.csv" into same directory with python script "SC0039_Exercise_CSV_Assignment_St_Lib_MC.py". In this script standard library modules were used.
2. Run the Python script and CSV file in the same directory.

## Using Pandas
1. Since it was asked to used standard library in the assignment, I have prefered to use below script. However we could have used this SC0039_Exercise_CSV_Assignment_MC_Version_Pandas.py
2. Run the Python script and CSV file in the same directory.
